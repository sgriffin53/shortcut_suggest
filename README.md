An AutoHotKey script for using abbreviated shortcuts for full words as well as a Python script to help learn the abbreviations.

To use the AHK script, install AutoHotKey and run the AutoHotKey.ahk script. You will then be able to type shortcuts for full words, e.g. 'cs' will expand to 'because', 'pla' will expand to 'professional'. There are 2,320 shortcuts in the script.

To use the shortcut suggestion script, run main.py, and a console window should appear. Then, while you're typing, the suggestion script will show you the abbreviations for the top 10 words used, as well as showing abbreviations for the most recently used words at the bottom. Common words will be shown with "!!!" before them to show their importance.
